    "To read in the data, we first loaded in the `tidyverse` library. `tidyverse` is a package in the R coding language used in data science for reading, wrangling, analysis, and visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data was collected from two files : `players.csv`, which informs us of participant characteristics, and `sessions.csv`, which details every individual play session. In order to maintain reproducability, we published these files into our Github repository and read them in using a URL. The resulting datasets were named `players` and `sessions`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was then made accessible for `tidyverse` functions ('tidied') before it was displayed. In our case, this meant reformatting the `hashedEmail` column to have underscores (`_`) between its words and using `as.POSIXct()` to reformat the start and end times in `sessions` to be `dttm` variables, which represent dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `players` and `sessions` were displayed using the `head()` function, which shows the first six rows of a dataset."
