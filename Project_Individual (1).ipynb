The age variable will be treated as a continuous feature, and experience will be analyzed categorically. Since the goal is to predict subscription likelihood based on these two factors, I would use K-Nearest Neighbors for this task. I'd use the KNN method since it can handle non-linear patterns as well as the experience categories (non-numeric), showing how age and experience influence the likelihood of subscription."

    "First, upon seeing the 2 available datasets, there is a `players.csv` file that includes data about individual players, such as name, experience, playtime, subscription status, gender, age, and hashed email. The total amount of observations is 197, and number of variables is 7. The `age` variable is numerical, and we can calculate the mean and standard deviation to better understand player demographics. The `subscription_status` variable is a boolean (true or false), which could be important to our analysis of predicting newsletter subscriptions. The player experience variable is categorical, representing player classifications which we need. Some potential issues with this data include missing values in certain columns, such as the age category in `players.csv`. There are 2 observations with `N/A` in that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sessions.csv` file records individual play sessions, with start and end times variables. There is a hashed email variable, start time and end time, as well as the original start and end time. There are five variables total. The dataset mainly contains observations on the time players put into the game. The start and end times are in a date format, which is not numerical, while the original start and end times are numerical which measures how long a player was engaged in a session  which reflects the demand on the server during gameplay. However, these values are extremely big and very hard to read, so we would need to standardize the data."

For pre-processing the data, do na.rm = TRUE for the missing values, standardize the data for age and playing hours, and then see if there is any variance in people's experiences if they are subscribed. The information will be split into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%), and I'll also use k-fold cross-validation to achieve a better estimate. This should allow us to identify predictors that make the most contributions to subscription probability!"
